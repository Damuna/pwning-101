# Introduction & Tools
## .exe & .dll
Every executable `.exe`, will have to call a DLL, a dinamically Linked Library, which is on the disk. They contain the functions that are being called by the executable. 

Given an executable, to understand which DLL it is linked to, monitor the process with`ProcMon64` from [SysInternals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/sysinternals/downloads/procmon).

Use `ilspycmd` on Linux to read the source code, or [dnSpy](https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy) on Windows, if you also need to debug.

### From Linux
1. `ilspycmd` (On Kali): is NET **decompiler**, it takes compiled .NET binaries and converts them back into readable C# source code.
	- Usually System and microsoft are not interesting:
		```bash
		ilspycmd --nested-directories -p -o src [EXE/DLL]
		```
2. go in the `src` directory and grep for interesting strings to find interesting files
3. C# online compiler
### From Windows
#### x64dbg

- To avoid going through any `dll` files, navigate to `Options` -> `Preferences`, uncheck everything except `Exit Breakpoint`

-  right click inside the `CPU` view and `Follow in Memory Map`

- Check `MAP` types files for credentials &rarr; double click, check if interesting &rarr;  right-click on the address and select `Dump Memory to File`

  ```cmd
  .\strings64.exe [FILE]
  ```

#### Thick Clients 

Applications that are installed locally on our computers, thus they do not require internet access to run.

Monitor the process with`ProcMon64` from [SysInternals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/sysinternals/downloads/procmon), look for generated files

- Run `strings64` on it
- `ProcMon64` from [SysInternals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) and monitoring the process after running it on the terminal
  - If some files are created, change the permissions of the folder to disallow file deletions &rarr; Look at the content
  - Check .bat files, change them (e.g. if they delete somthing)
- inspect `.exe` with `x64dbg` and look for memory dumps &rarr; run `strings`
- Use `de4dot` for `.NET` file as deobfuscator and depacker &rarr;Â read the source code by dragging and dropping it onto the `DnSpy` executable

## .elf 
ghidra (used by NSA so it is D O P E)

## .jar files 
jadx-gui &rarr; open the file in the GUI

## .apk file 
unzip -> decompile what you find (hacktricks)
